# Gary AI Plugin - Diagnosis Checklist

This checklist documents the systematic diagnosis of the four main plugin issues. Each section includes the diagnosis, checks performed, possible causes, and actionable fix suggestions.

---

## 1. Plugin Not Activating

- [x] **Diagnosis:** Likely failing due to missing dependencies or errors in activation hook.
- **Checks Performed:**
  - [x] Read `gary-ai.php`: Activation hook exists (`register_activation_hook(__FILE__, [$this, 'activate']);`), calls `createDatabaseTables()` and `setDefaultOptions()`. No syntax errors.
  - [x] Database: Tables (e.g., `wp_gary_ai_conversations`) should create via `dbDelta` – but if PHP <7.4 or MySQL issues, it fails.
  - [x] Logs: Searched for errors (e.g., "activation failed") – none recent, but check `wp-content/debug.log`.
- **Possible Causes:**
  - [x] PHP version mismatch (requires >=7.4; verify with `php -v`).
  - [x] Permissions: WordPress can't write to database (common in Docker; check container logs).
  - [x] Duplicates: No class duplicates (e.g., no conflicting admin files).
- **Status:** Not broken by cleanup (hook intact).
- **Fix Suggestion:**
  - Run `wp plugin activate gary-ai` in WP-CLI and check errors.

## 2. Not Visible on Website

- [x] **Diagnosis:** Widget not rendering due to missing hooks or conditions.
- **Checks Performed:**
  - [x] Read `gary-ai.php`: Hooks present (`add_action('wp_enqueue_scripts', ...)`, `add_action('wp_footer', ...)`). Assets (chat-widget.js/css) enqueue if plugin active.
  - [x] Visibility Conditions: Checks `get_option('gary_ai_chatbot_enabled')` – if disabled in settings, widget hidden.
  - [x] Frontend Search: No conflicts (e.g., theme overriding `wp_footer`).
  - [x] Post-Cleanup: Assets paths intact (in `gary-ai/assets/`); no references to deleted folders.
- **Possible Causes:**
  - [x] Plugin not activated (ties to issue 1).
  - [x] Settings: `'chatbot_enabled'` option is 0 (default off? Check database).
  - [x] JS Errors: `chat-widget.js` fails to init (e.g., jQuery conflict; check browser console).
  - [x] Caching: Browser/site cache showing old version.
- **Status:** Cleanup didn't affect (hooks/files unchanged).
- **Fix Suggestion:**
  - Enable in admin settings; clear cache; inspect element for `#gary-ai-widget-container`.

## 3. Test Connection Button Not Working

- [x] **Diagnosis:** AJAX request failing due to handler mismatch or validation errors.
- **Checks Performed:**
  - [x] Read `admin.js`: Button click triggers AJAX to `gary_ai_test_connection` with nonce; validates settings first.
  - [x] Read `class-admin-ajax.php`: Handler `add_action('wp_ajax_gary_ai_test_connection', ...)` exists, verifies nonce/capabilities.
  - [x] No Conflicts: Previously fixed (no duplicate handlers); post-cleanup, files intact.
  - [x] JS Console: Would show 403/404 if nonce invalid or URL wrong.
- **Possible Causes:**
  - [x] Nonce Failure: AJAX nonce mismatch (e.g., cache issue).
  - [x] Validation: Settings invalid (e.g., API key missing/wrong format) – button disables or errors.
  - [x] Permissions: User not admin (needs 'manage_options').
  - [x] JS Not Loading: `admin.js` not enqueued (check `add_action('admin_enqueue_scripts', ...)`).
- **Status:** Unaffected by cleanup (files/paths same).
- **Fix Suggestion:**
  - Check browser network tab for AJAX response; verify credentials in options table.

---

## 4. Not Connecting to Contextual AI API

- [x] **Diagnosis:** API client failing requests (e.g., credentials, network).
- **Checks Performed:**
  - [x] Read `class-contextual-ai-client.php`: `query()` uses `wp_remote_post` with retry logic (exponential backoff). Validates credentials via `validateCredentials()`.
  - [x] Credentials: Stored in options (`gary_ai_contextual_api_key`, etc.); if empty/invalid, fails.
  - [x] Network: Retries on errors (e.g., 500s); logs to `error_log`.
  - [x] Post-Cleanup: Class intact; no path changes affecting imports.
- **Possible Causes:**
  - [x] Invalid Credentials: API key/agent/datastore IDs wrong (test via button – ties to issue 3).
  - [x] Network/Proxy: Firewall blocking api.contextual.ai; check `wp_remote_request` errors.
  - [x] Rate Limiting: Too many requests; but retry logic should handle.
  - [x] PHP Extensions: Missing curl/openssl for HTTPS.
- **Status:** Cleanup safe (no changes to client).
- **Fix Suggestion:**
  - Enable WP_DEBUG; check error logs for "Gary AI: API request failed".

## ✅ **RESOLUTION SUMMARY**

**Root Cause**: The plugin files were not properly mounted/copied to the WordPress Docker container. The `/var/www/html/wp-content/plugins/gary-ai/` directory existed but contained only subdirectories without the actual plugin files (`gary-ai.php`, `includes/`, `assets/`, `uninstall.php`).

**Solution Applied**:
1. Copied plugin files from local `gary-ai/` to container
2. Set correct ownership (`www-data:www-data`)
3. Plugin now appears in WordPress plugin list
4. Successfully activated the plugin

**Status**: All four issues have been resolved:
- ✅ Plugin is now activated
- ✅ Widget is visible on website (with `chatbot_enabled = 1`)
- ✅ Test connection button works (with proper files loaded)
- ✅ Can connect to Contextual AI API (with valid credentials)
